# Discord Whitelist URL

As a community we're going to push for Partner - one of the areas we struggle with as a Rust community is the playerbase posting inappropriate embedded GIF and URLs.

This bot solves that by Whitelisting specific domains, you can ignore channels, users, and categories for your announcements and info channels.

# Possible Future Updates

- Focus mode, so rather than running globally the bot will only run on specific channels and categories.

## Features

- Monitors all channels, categories, users, for specific messages containing a URL and deletes if not whitelisted.





## Installation

Ensure Node.js is installed on the local machine

Install Packages using
```
npm i
```
Run the Bot using
```
node index.js
```
